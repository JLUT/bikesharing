**Challenge Overview**

In this module, we worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.And in this challenge, we put together our final presentation and analysis for investors. We selected the questions we wanted to answer, conducted independent research, crafted our story in Tableau, and then created our written analysis.

**Challenge Summary**

For this portion of the presentation, we worked with a team that is trying to answer core questions about opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we wanted to format our story so it was persuasive. We also wanted to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

 And I created two additional visualizations also.
